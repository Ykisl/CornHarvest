This is a fan made remake of the Simple Corn mod.
Original mod by cleverpanda714.

This mod adds corn and dishes from it as if it was added by the mojang themselves.
The project has been rewritten from scratch to newer versions of Minecraft.

About corn:
- Corn seeds as well as wheat seeds can be obtained from grass.
- Corn can be cooked or made into popcorn by its kernels.
- Some desert and plains villagers buy corn in exchange for emeralds.
- Corn can be used to breed pigs and corn kernels can be used to breed chickens.
